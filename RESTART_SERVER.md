## Yes, you need to restart the server!

After making code changes, you need to restart the development server to pick up the updates.

### Steps:

1. **Stop the current server:**
   - In the terminal where `npm run dev` is running
   - Press `Ctrl + C` (or `Cmd + C` on Mac) to stop it

2. **Restart the server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Try registering again:**
   - The server should now have the improved error logging
   - Check the terminal for detailed error messages

If the server is running, stop it first (Ctrl+C), then:
```bash
npm run dev
```
