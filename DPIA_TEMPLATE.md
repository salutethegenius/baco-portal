# BACO Portal – Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) Template

_Use this template when introducing new features or changes that may significantly affect the privacy of members or other individuals (e.g. new categories of sensitive data, integrations, analytics or automated decision-making)._

## 1. Project / change overview

- **Project name**:
- **Owner / sponsor**:
- **Date**:
- **Version**:

### 1.1 Summary of the change

Describe what is being proposed, how it works in the BACO Portal, and which parts of the system will be affected.

---

## 2. Description of processing

### 2.1 Purposes

- What is the primary purpose of the processing?
- Are there any secondary purposes (e.g. analytics, reporting, compliance)?

### 2.2 Data subjects and data categories

- Who will be affected? (e.g. members, applicants, event attendees, officers)
- What types of data will be processed? Distinguish between:
  - Identification/contact data.
  - Professional/membership data.
  - Financial/billing data.
  - Uploaded documents.
  - Sensitive data (e.g. disciplinary information, criminal convictions, health).

### 2.3 Processing operations

- How will data be collected?
- How will it be stored, accessed and used?
- Will data be combined with other data sets? If so, how?
- Will there be any automated decisions or profiling?

### 2.4 Recipients and international transfers

- Which internal roles will have access?
- Which external service providers or third parties (if any) will receive data?
- Will any data be transferred outside The Bahamas? If yes, to which countries and under what safeguards?

---

## 3. Necessity and proportionality

### 3.1 Legal basis and fairness

- Which legal basis (or bases) under the Bahamian Data Protection Act applies? (e.g. consent, performance of contract, legal obligation, legitimate interests)
- How will individuals be informed (Privacy Notice updates, inline notices, consent wording)?

### 3.2 Data minimisation and retention

- Are all data fields strictly necessary for the stated purposes?
- Can any high-risk or free-text fields be avoided, reduced or better structured?
- What retention period will apply and how will deletion or anonymisation be enforced technically?

### 3.3 Rights and transparency

- How will individuals exercise their rights (access, correction, objection, deletion) for this processing?
- Are there changes required in self-service tools or admin workflows to support these rights?

---

## 4. Risk assessment

Identify risks to the rights and freedoms of individuals (not just to BACO). Consider:

- Unauthorised access, loss or alteration of data.
- Misuse or over-collection of sensitive data.
- Discrimination, reputational harm or financial harm.
- Loss of confidentiality of disciplinary or background information.
- Inaccurate data being used for important decisions.

For each risk, complete the table:

| Risk description | Likelihood (Low/Med/High) | Impact (Low/Med/High) | Overall risk level |
| ---------------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------ |
|                  |                           |                        |                    |

---

## 5. Mitigation measures

For each identified risk, propose and document controls such as:

- Technical measures (access control, logging, encryption, configuration).
- Organisational measures (policies, procedures, approval workflows).
- Training and awareness for relevant BACO officers.

Update the risk table with a second column set showing the residual risk after controls are applied.

## 6. Consultation and approvals

### 6.1 Internal consultation

- Which BACO committees or officers have been consulted?
- Summary of feedback and any changes made as a result.

### 6.2 External consultation (if appropriate)

  Decision (approve / approve with conditions / reject):

- **BACO Executive / Governance body** (if applicable):  
  Name:

## 7. Implementation and review

- Key implementation steps and owners.
